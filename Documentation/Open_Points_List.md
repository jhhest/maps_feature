Needed feedback:
by Jasper, Mike And Jan:
- [ ] First Evaluation date?  
- [ ] Projectstart
- [ ] Projectplan
- [ ] The Repository is not private to be able to use gitkraken.

Practical questions?

- [ ] Which license will we use?
- [ ] Which products do we have to evaluate to projectowner?
- [ ] Is project plan sufficent?
- [ ] How do we make a software requirements?
- [ ] How do we communicate with projectowner. I.e. to ask if Software requirement is sufficent.
